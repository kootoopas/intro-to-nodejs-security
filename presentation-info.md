An introduction to node.js security
===================================

### Summary
In this introductory presentation, we will define and talk about some common types of security vulnerabilities and attacks, which may or may not be exclusive to the node.js stack. Furthermore, we will try to mess with a vulnerable and a secure set of examples, as well as examine and compare the code behind each one. We will become both the attacker and the defender; an attacker of the attacker even, if I may.

### A few things about me
I'm a computer science student and a (junior) web developer. I consider myself a noobie, since I don't have extensive experience on the field. I've lately grown an interest in nodejs web apps, APIs and delving into how http works.
